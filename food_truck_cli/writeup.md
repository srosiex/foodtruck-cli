# Write Up

## How I would convert to a full scale web app:
    -Create a front end using React, CSS, and HTML 
    -Handle data more efficiently using React Redux for state management
        -Ability to store food trucks and info to enable user to browse more information.
        -Ability to switch through separate pages.
    -Add additional functions such as ability to search for food trucks for different times other than current time/date.
    -Implement RESTful routes for clear routing
